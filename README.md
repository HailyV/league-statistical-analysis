    <h2>Key Match Insights</h2>
</div>
<ul>
    <li>In League of Legends, <strong>Dragon control</strong> is often considered a critical objective that can significantly impact a team's chances of winning.</li>
    <li>Teams that secure more dragons have better late-game scaling, buffs, and map control, leading to a higher probability of success.</li>
    <li>Once four dragons have been secured by a team, that is the max amount a team can have. However if there is a stale-mate of dragon control then one team could acquire 3 versus the opposite team having 4</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Analysis Question</h2>
</div>
<p style="text-align: center;">
    Does obtaining more dragons correlate with a higher win rate in (<strong>tier-one league</strong>) League of Legends matches?  
</p>
<p>
    Dragon control is a key part of professional play, offering buffs that scale throughout the game. Investigating whether controlling more dragons aligns 
    with a higher win rate could reveal insights about team strategies, objective prioritization, and meta preferences.
