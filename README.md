    <h3>Key Match Insights</h3>
</div>
<ul>
    <li>In League of Legends, <strong>Dragon control</strong> is often considered a critical objective that can significantly impact a team's chances of winning.</li>
    <li>Teams that secure more dragons have better late-game scaling, buffs, and map control, leading to a higher probability of success.</li>
    <li>Once four dragons have been secured by a team, that is the max amount a team can have. However, if there is a stalemate of dragon control, one team could acquire 3 versus the opposite team having 4.</li>
</ul>

    <h3>Analysis Question</h3>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
    <p>Does obtaining more dragons correlate with a higher win rate in (<strong>tier-one league</strong>) League of Legends matches?</p>
    <p>
        Dragon control is a key part of professional play, offering buffs that scale throughout the game. Investigating whether controlling more dragons aligns 
        with a higher win rate could reveal insights about team strategies, objective prioritization, and meta preferences.
        This analysis could help coaches make better choices as to whether dragons are an important factor in winning the game.

    The dataset contains approximately <strong>150,000 rows</strong> of data. For this analysis, we will focus on the following columns:
</p>

| **Column**        | **Definition**                                                                                     |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **dragons**        | The number of dragons secured.                                                                    |
| **league**         | The tier-one league where the match took place (e.g., LCS, LEC, LCK, LPL).                        |
